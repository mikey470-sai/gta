# GTA V Vehicle Data Analysis and Prediction

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the GTA V vehicle dataset. It covers the complete workflow starting from data cleaning and preprocessing to visualization and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, including handling string-formatted numerical values and lap times
- Performed exploratory data analysis using multiple visualization techniques
- Built a predictive model to estimate vehicle lap times
- Evaluated model performance using the R² score

## Key Highlights
- End-to-end data analysis pipeline
- Focus on real-world data issues during cleaning
- Visual insights into vehicle performance
- Predictive modeling for lap time estimation

## Future Improvements
- Include additional features such as vehicle class and manufacturer for multivariate models
- Explore classification approaches by grouping vehicles into performance categories
- Perform time-series analysis if temporal data becomes available
